# lock

This project is my attempt of a door lock that has the following considerations and features in mind:
- Free software and easily hackable
- Can be used on an existing key-based locking mechanism
- Does not compromise security (at least hardware-wise)
- Does not compromise usability (existing system must continue to work in the same way)
- Safe in the event of a power failure
- Impossible to lock you out using a key
- Indoor modifications only
- 3D print as much as possible (we're not going to [3D print a motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsSm65DAcCg&vl=en), but you get the idea)
- Low cost (aiming for less than $10)
- Compatible with most doors (focus on EU for now)
- Detect manual opening

I will also allow some limitations:
- Will assume working wifi
- Will not be low-power, so there will be a cable on the door
- The existing lock cylinder 

### Existing work
There are already [some Smart Locks out there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah4JGisH3zM)
that are pretty close to this one, but they miss one or more of the above features. Also, I just want to make my own.
